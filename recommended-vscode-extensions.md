# Recommended VS Code extensions

The first two are for TypeScript development and the rest are extensions that improves the DX (Developer Experience).

## Pretty TypeScript Errors

Make TypeScript errors prettier and human-readable in VSCode.

## Twoslash Query Comments

A tiny extension for VS Code that lets you use `// ^?` inside your editor to inline highlight types. Re-uses the existing TypeScript tooling infra in `*.ts`, `*.tsx`, `*.js`, and `*.jsx` files, simply adding inline info.

Useful for keyboard warriors or folks working on complex types and want to see how changes propagate throughout other types.

## Error Lens

ErrorLens turbo-charges language diagnostic features by making diagnostics stand out more prominently, highlighting the entire line wherever a diagnostic is generated by the language and also prints the message inline.
